# RedditCrawler

The goal of the project was to crawl Financial Reddit pages to collect posts within these pages as a local database and be able to create a search engine to search for posts that have relevant information that match a user's query. The project was coded entirely in Python and utilized Praw as the crawler, Lucene as the search index along with JSON files to store data.
