Get your family history as well, this is invaluable as far as predicting what your future medical issues and costs could be. \n\n2) Full body MRIs aren't a good screening test for cancer typically, very hard to get covered by insurance and are very expensive (think few thousand dollars, yay USA insurance! /s).\n\nI am 27 and my mother died of colon cancer in her early 30s. It was recommended I get my first screening in my early 20s and a polyp was indeed found. If I hadn't known my family history, talked to my PCP and got the test done I would have also had cancer in/before my 30s. Now I know every 3 years my medical bills are gonna be a few hundred more than usual and I can plan for it. So indeed, catching something early is the plan!", "A better word might be \"checks\" rather than \"scans\".

I maxxed my 403b contribution and took us on vacation last year. :)", "This makes sense for the derm but other cancers don't typically manifest on the exterior like moles. If i'm worried about colon cancer, there's no easy way to check that.", "I mean...it's not \"easy\", but there is a way. If that's a genuine concern for you, you can talk to your primary care doctor and get a referral to a gastroenterologist or proctologist who can do a colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy as needed. Most 26 year olds don't need that check up without any symptoms, though, because colon cancer isn't common in 20-somethings."]}, {"title": "Weekday Help and Victory Thread for the week of May 01, 2023", "score": 24, "id": "134j9w8", "subreddit": "personalfinance", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/134j9w8/weekday_help_and_victory_thread_for_the_week_of/", "num_comments": 219, "body": "### If you need help, please check the [PF Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/index) to see if your question might be answered there.\n\nThis thread is for personal finance questions, discussions, and sharing your success stories:\n\n1. *Please make a top-level comment if you want to ask a question!

We found the car seat and stroller we want and it\u2019s a bit expensive ($1200). She grew up in a financially troubled household and really struggled with being comfortable around finance and spending money. I usually have to coax her into spending money and treating herself. I sometimes think it\u2019s because she feels she has less right to enjoy our money because I am the breadwinner. Well I told her to go ordering the items today since there was a sale and we would get a gift card back for buying them. Later I see she cancelled the order and purchased the color she wanted more instead even though it cost an extra $50. It just feels good to see her comfortable enough in our financial lifestyle to go out and treat herself without being prompted to do so.", "Can someone help me understand if it is better to be a contractor or a part time employee for a company?

The issue came down to how \"years of service\" were calculated. The OP had worked 3.5 years, and assumed they were 100% vested after 3 years of service. But their plan defined a year of service as 1,000+ hours logged. OP ended up being under the limit, and unknowingly left before their match was 100% vested.\r  \n\r  \nThis was a huge wake-up call for me. I started a new full-time job halfway through 2022 and have been contributing aggressively to my 401(k). My plan is structured the same way as above, and I realized I didn't understand the vesting period as well as I thought I did. I intended to stay at my job at least long enough to be fully vested, and assumed that would be a minimum of three years. But now I was afraid that 2022 might not count as a full year of service.\r  \n\r  \nToday, I went back through my timesheets and calculated the hours. And... I am at 1,069 (nice). I guess it ends up being the same outcome as I previously thought, but now I know to double check my assumptions.\r  \n\r  \nSo  thank you all for sharing your experience and advice. It really helps people like me.", "I just paid off my car.\n\nBack in 2014/15 I bought a Dodge Dart from a dealership and got an *awful* interest rate at 16%. I had no idea what I was getting myself into and had barely paid a few grand off after 3 years, I was at a loss at what to do at the time. I wasn't making great money, so putting extra towards it was neigh impossible.\n\nFast forward to the end 2017, I wanted to rid myself of the car and the loan, so I traded it towards another vehicle and went completely upside down on the loan. It didn't occur to me to refinance the vehicle, I was still so new and inept when it came to finances that I thought this was the best move. I ended up with $36,000 debt on a car worth $23,000.\n\nHowever, after 5 long years I made my final payment on Monday. I've learned a lot about finances since then and am looking forward to having no car payment for as long as possible. It's a huge relief to have that debt taken care of and free up money to pay down a few small loans over the next year or two.", "My net worth is set to hit $100k USD tomorrow! 26yo M from KY.

Many of my friends talk about their credit cards and earning points and miles for travel on them. I would be interested in opening one to start earning these points and I know I have some research to do on picking a card, but the idea of \"never open a credit card!\" has always been emphasized and credit cards have always had a negative connotation associated with them (which I think is slightly unfair if responsible with them).\r  \n\r  \nI'm not looking for step-by-step advice, more of just a general direction to go after clearing this major hurdle.

So, today I was able to enroll my company's 401k plan, but I found out they don't have a match option. This kind of defeats the purpose of investing in it. I was thinking about maybe applying for Robinhood's 401K since they at least offer a 1% match, and have the benefit of not having to transfer my 401K around when I switch or change companies.

I am self employed and work part time; my partner works full time for an employer. Combined income about $250k. We pay for part time childcare- about $24k/year.\n\nOur house currently has 1 bathroom and laundry in the basement which is tricky to access because the stairs are very steep and narrow. We have a plan to bring the laundry up and add a half bath upstairs, which involves renovating the kitchen. The estimated cost is about $70k. We had planned to do it this year and had about $45k saved and were going to look for a HELOC or home equity loan. Unfortunately we got totally walloped with a huge tax bill ($18k) because we miscalculated our withholding. \n\nWhich brings me to the question. We have ~$35k in savings that we could liquidate remaining but this would leave us with $15k in our emergency fund. I\u2019m thinking we liquidate $25k and try to get the rest in a loan that we could then pay off in 10 years. We would start the project this winter, by which point we\u2019d have another $10k saved (we are saving pretty aggressively and my partner get a bonus in the fall; we estimated that it would be half the size it was last year to be conservative but it will likely be $10k-$20k so we would have $45-$55k). \n\nBased on that, is there a reason to go for the HELOC over the loan? Loans seem to have lower interest although you pay interest immediately but I\u2019m not sure I understand why a HELOC would be better in this type of situation (a one-off Reno). The renovation will add value to our house and also make our lives a lot easier- potty training is imminent and if we do have another kid, not having to navigate the dangerous staircase (there\u2019s unfortunately no other way to fix it without re-doing almost the whole house because of the way it\u2019s laid out) would be a huge bonus.

In particular, taxes and homeowners can vary wildly based on location.  Don\u2019t trust a generic internet calculator on those things.  Ask your realtor or look at real estate listings, which will include the current property tax (but recognize that will change).\n\nGenerally speaking though, your logic, thought processes and what you can afford are dead on.\n\nThere\u2019s also going to be a few thousand of closing costs.

Unless you have other savings that you can pull from (or you have an IRA that you're willing to pull from for the first time homebuyer's penalty exception), you're going to find yourself short on cash for a few months while you wait for your wife to start pulling in an income.\n\nAlso, the promise of future income isn't going to matter to the bank when it comes to approving you for a loan.  They want to see actual, steady income.\n\nYou're also on a fairly aggressive timeline to try to have a house move in ready by August 1st.  That's less than 3 months to find a house, make an offer, have it approved, have it inspected, close on the loan, and have the sellers move out.  That's not that realistic, and it's going to lead you to rushing into something that's probably not ideal for you.  Not to mention that as an FHA borrower, they're more stringent on the condition of the property and they might require the seller to make certain repairs before they'll approve the loan, it also puts you at a negotiating disadvantage against other buyers that are using conventional loans.\n\nI think that you need to plan to rent for another year while you establish your income, build your savings, and start the house hunting process earlier next year.", "If I were you I wouldn\u2019t do it unless you have the down payment and closing costs AND at least a 6 month emergency fund (total of what all expenses would be).

As you will be paying on the interest for the first few years of the purchase and less on the principle, if you have the ability and can swing a 15 year loan instead of 30 it is something to consider.

You will also need money for an appraisal, inspection (1k), and closing costs (5-8k).   Given your expected savings of around 10k, these additional costs will eat up that cash.  I would save more and/or buy a cheaper home on that income.", "I think the loan math is sound, along with the income and monthly calculation.\n\nMy concerns would be the insurance and property taxes look low to me,  there's no accounting for any closing costs which can be a few grand, and will a lender be able to accept your wife's salary as part of the approval (or will it be needed at all?)", "I used to have a townhouse FHA loan with 0 money down @ 290k in 2013 - and we paid about ~$2100 all said in mortgage + PMI. I don't think you are entirely too far off but all these things are estimations. You'll need to factor in utilities into your monthly roll up. Getting that information upfront is really awkward to but for folks like us that budget it is kinda essential.\n\nAs an aside, doing it off potential incomes is a bad thought process, you'll just need to figure out if you are able to make it just off your or your wife's income alone. It might be too aggressive if one of you loses a job for whatever reason - as I remember making about ~1500 a paycheck @ 50k and 1600-1700 @60k depending on how aggressive I was with the benefits.

Be well.", "Property taxes really surprised me with my first house. I knew I\u2019d have them, but adding them to the mortgage payment was psychologically difficult because it raises the payment I\u2019d been budgeting against.  Unlike me, sounds like you\u2019re accounting for them. Don\u2019t forget to add in a lump sum escrow for taxes \u2014 the mortgage company will want to have padding in the escrow account, maybe even up to a 1/2 year payment. They can also rebalance at any time if taxes have gone up and charge more, so keep an eye out for that. \n\nAnother items to check for: some loans will let you recast 1 or more times. This means if you make a large lump sum payment, and maybe if you\u2019ve done something like have kept a high enough balance in an associated checking account for long enough, they\u2019ll recalculate the amortization schedule if you engage them. Otherwise extra payments will not typically lower your monthly payment but just reduce the number of payments (taking it off the end.. so possibly saving interest\u2026). I had planned on a lump sum pay down but learned this too late.  So you may want to budget $$ in an account you cannot touch.\n\nRelated to $$ in an account you cannot touch, sometimes you can get a lower rate if you open an associated account (that may also have a min. balance requirement). \n\nAlso, if you\u2019re thinking of ever needing a HELOC and there\u2019s equity in the house when you\u2019re buying it, it\u2019s usually much cheaper to get the HELOC at the same time.  This can be helpful because as a home owner, you can all but guarantee every appliance will break in the first year. Hot water heater. Laundry. Heating system. Dish washer. Fridge. The roof will leak.  It\u2019s ridiculous. Budget for these\u2026 rainy day fund should be 3-6 months of expenses in cash, which can cover some of these maintenance items but (in my opinion) is really intended to cover economic hardships, so having a plan for maintenance is important.\n\nFinally, many say to get the biggest fixed rate mortgage you can afford (<\u2014not saying to live beyond the calculations you\u2019re doing \u2026 this means don\u2019t get one too big) for the longest period. Don\u2019t chase 15yr or 20yr for slightly lower interest rates. The payments are higher. Instead, if early payoff is your goal, get a 30yr and make extra payments. If things go sideways for you, you can make smaller payments at the 30-yr threshold. \n\nOh, and avoid paying points to lower your interest rates or chasing variable rate ARMs. \n\nDidn\u2019t check the rest of the posts re: these comments, so apologies if they\u2019re duplicative.", "You are failing to account for repairs and maintenance.

I bought in 2018 so your results may vary, but you can do it in 2 years.\n\nHere are my tips.\n\nTry to own everything, that includes your vehicle, if you do end up having to finance a car get the bare minimum. Anything you have debt-wise will count against your ability to qualify for a mortgage. It makes no sense but you can get a newer car after your mortgage.\n\nTry to expand your amount of credit cards, but never carry a balance. Use them for things you would have bought anyways with your debit card and only if you already have the funds in the bank. Having many lets you keep the reported balances low. Banks want to see that history.\n\nDon't ever be late no matter what. It can really ruin your chances. \n\nIf you are really serious about buying a house banks want you to stay put for at least 2 years and rent for 2 years. If you get fired or evicted you will have to start over. You can job hop, but it's counter-productive for people who want to buy houses unless you can WFH.\n\nGovernment jobs don't pay much but have pretty decent stability. If you are really serious and are able to buy in 5 years, it's not a bad idea to stay the rest of the 5 to get vested.  This kills two birds because if you want to move on and sell your house you would be in the green. Depending on where you are the workload won't be as crazy as a private industry so use downtime to expand your skills. Others have said working on a degree, that is a good idea. Some states also have student loan forgiveness as well if you work in government. \n\nWhen you are ready to buy a good first-time program is the USDA loan program. You mentioned you live in a LCOL area so its possible property near you will be eligible.  They will give you a somewhat higher rate but you can always refinance down the road. They don't require a downpayment, so that leaves you with more available to cover closing and for a home emergency fund. If you can save more and use other loan programs, more power to you.", "I am a hs drop out, my first job was Wendy\u2019s. I only worked in the food service industry my whole life. But I worked hard, 48-70 hr weeks, and I saved harder like (50%). I lived in my car for a while. All my money was saved in investments, never in a bank. I planned to save 25x my yearly expenses by 30, then never work again, just live off 4% of my net worth each year. I always kept this goal in mind adjusting what I need to save each year to hit that mark. I never Carry debt over 5% I always take debt under 4%.Learn about the power of compound interest!

But unlike a credit card, the money used for that purchase isn't lent to you, it is pulled directly from your bank account, usually your checking account.

Before that she was making essentially nothing - what she did make was under the table. My knowledge of social security is not deep, but from what I've read, it calculates based on the previous 35 years of monthly income history. The last 4 years have been lucrative for her, but before that it was a slow and steady rise from about $25k with a pretty big jump around 2019.\n\nRegardless, our last ditch plan is to convince her to sell her 4 bedroom house with 3 acres, collect the $30k of equity she has and rent a nice one or two bedroom living situation. And just that money for rent and food - she would be covered in that sense for the remainder of her life.

It cost some savings but for the rest of the year all my contributions will stay in the HSA.

The trope \"dividends are just a forced sale\" is an overly simplistic take, but at a high level dividends themselves is just a return of the companies net income to the shareholder. If company A and company B have the same net income and same value, but company B returns a dividend while company A holds onto the cash, in an efficient market company A will increase in value relative to company B.\n\n[There's a really good Reddit post with comments that go over this](https://www.reddit.com/r/M1Finance/comments/d028op/why_im_not_a_dividend_investor_and_why_you/) idea, but the salient point is that you can sell a stock that appreciates, or you can take a dividend, but functionally it's pretty much the same thing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>A company\u2019s or fund\u2019s dividend has already been intrinsically factored into its value and subsequently, its share price.

You are not gaining anything extra by receiving a dividend. $1 is $1 is $1; there is no free lunch in the market.  \n>  \n>For a simplistic, hypothetical example, let\u2019s say you own Company ABC and you transfer $1 from its company bank account to your personal bank account. Your net worth has not increased as a result; you own the company, so you owned that $1 the whole time. You\u2019ve just subtracted it from somewhere - in this case the company\u2019s value - and added it somewhere else - your pocket.  \n>  \n>Similarly, your partial ownership of a different company (in the form of shares) may be worth $1 that the company holds. Upon transferring it to you in the form of a dividend, you are no wealthier as a result, as the company\u2019s value has just decreased by the amount of its dividend payment. Specifically, with the dividend, you own more shares at a lower price. Without the dividend, you own fewer shares at a higher price. They are identical.
