Get your family history as well, this is invaluable as far as predicting what your future medical issues and costs could be. \n\n2) Full body MRIs aren't a good screening test for cancer typically, very hard to get covered by insurance and are very expensive (think few thousand dollars, yay USA insurance! /s).\n\nI am 27 and my mother died of colon cancer in her early 30s. It was recommended I get my first screening in my early 20s and a polyp was indeed found.

I also unpaused all my recurring investments in my stock portfolio, started contributing to an IRA, and just graduated community college with an associates in accounting. I know this might not seem impressive to most of y\u2019all here, but for the first time ever I\u2019m starting to feel like I have my shit together somewhat.

We found the car seat and stroller we want and it\u2019s a bit expensive ($1200). She grew up in a financially troubled household and really struggled with being comfortable around finance and spending money. I usually have to coax her into spending money and treating herself. I sometimes think it\u2019s because she feels she has less right to enjoy our money because I am the breadwinner. Well I told her to go ordering the items today since there was a sale and we would get a gift card back for buying them. Later I see she cancelled the order and purchased the color she wanted more instead even though it cost an extra $50. It just feels good to see her comfortable enough in our financial lifestyle to go out and treat herself without being prompted to do so.", "Win: cash flowed an epic two week safari for my birthday\nFail: upon arrival back home, learned that a $40,000 hvac replacement was necessary (thought I had another year or two)\nSoothing salve: having no commercial debt (and obsessively reading this sub to know that this financing even existed) meant qualifying for 0% interest for 72 months from Wells Fargo rather than the 10% for 120 months the hvac company was offering. \n\nSo glad someone had a similar problem the same time I did and commenters mentioned the Carrier credit card! Saved me an incredible amount of money.", "I just paid off my car.\n\nBack in 2014/15 I bought a Dodge Dart from a dealership and got an *awful* interest rate at 16%. I had no idea what I was getting myself into and had barely paid a few grand off after 3 years, I was at a loss at what to do at the time. I wasn't making great money, so putting extra towards it was neigh impossible.\n\nFast forward to the end 2017, I wanted to rid myself of the car and the loan, so I traded it towards another vehicle and went completely upside down on the loan. It didn't occur to me to refinance the vehicle, I was still so new and inept when it came to finances that I thought this was the best move. I ended up with $36,000 debt on a car worth $23,000.\n\nHowever, after 5 long years I made my final payment on Monday. I've learned a lot about finances since then and am looking forward to having no car payment for as long as possible.

That's worth like $79k from pretty much last year (2015). Just looking for encouragement.

The issue came down to how \"years of service\" were calculated. The OP had worked 3.5 years, and assumed they were 100% vested after 3 years of service. But their plan defined a year of service as 1,000+ hours logged. OP ended up being under the limit, and unknowingly left before their match was 100% vested.\r  \n\r  \nThis was a huge wake-up call for me. I started a new full-time job halfway through 2022 and have been contributing aggressively to my 401(k). My plan is structured the same way as above, and I realized I didn't understand the vesting period as well as I thought I did. I intended to stay at my job at least long enough to be fully vested, and assumed that would be a minimum of three years. But now I was afraid that 2022 might not count as a full year of service.\r  \n\r  \nToday, I went back through my timesheets and calculated the hours. And... I am at 1,069 (nice). I guess it ends up being the same outcome as I previously thought, but now I know to double check my assumptions.\r  \n\r  \nSo  thank you all for sharing your experience and advice. It really helps people like me.", "Noob question: my emergency fund will be adequate in a few months, and I would like to start shifting my monthly savings into an investment portfolio. \n\nIs there a way for me to start routing that money (about $500 bi-weekly) to a platform that will automatically manage the money?\n\nI am comfortable with moderate-high risk and am focused on returns.", "I recently opened a SOFI HYSA. Set up my direct deposit, automated the whole thing. Ez pz.\r  \n\r  \nHowever, when poking around the SOFI web site it seems they only allow transfers to external banks using Plaid. My local bank does not participate with Plaid, so I'm concerned that any dollars that I need from SOFI will be hard to get to on the off chance of an emergency.\r  \n\r  \nHow are others dealing with this? Would it be prudent to just keep my credit card handy, and then pay off any emergencies with SOFI dollars from that account? Am I over thinking this?", "Hello! I'm hoping to get some advice on streamlining/consolidating various retirement accounts I have sitting around from former employers.\n\nMy current investments are:\n\nTIAA 403(b): approx. $16,000 in mutual funds. Net expense ratio is 0.45%. This is my current employer's retirement plan, so it is not going anywhere.\n\nFidelity 401(k): approx. $8,000 in mutual funds. Net expense ratio is 0.27%. This is a former employer's plan and can be moved.\n\nEdward Jones SEP: approx. $3,500 in mostly mutual funds. I can't easily tell what the expense ratio is, but I gather that EJ charges higher fees than most. This is a former employer's plan and can be moved.\n\nGuideline 401(k): approx. $350 in various Vanguard index funds. Expense ratios appear to be between 0.04% and 0.15%. This is technically still active; it's an account set up with my spouse's small business and only sporadically contributed to.\n\nI'm definitely looking at rolling the EJ into one of the other accounts, and possibly the Fidelity as well; between the options above, what would be the best place to put it? Should I open a new IRA somewhere instead of using the above options?", "I made a thread as well, but I figured it may help to post here too:\n\nHi r/PersonalFinance,\n\nI live in the US. My father died recently. I know this sounds morbid, but I\u2019ve been thinking about how best to use the money I\u2019m inheriting from him. I believe the total amount is somewhere between 300k-400k, and most of it is currently invested. \n\nAn obvious consideration is my student debt. I\u2019m a full time grad student and will have around 100k in loans when I graduate, but I\u2019m pretty sure I don\u2019t have to make payments on them until mid-2025. They\u2019re the federal grad loans so I could probably just go figure that out. I personally don\u2019t like the idea of investing very much, where (based on my understanding) you don\u2019t easily have access to the money if you need it, and the actual amount is subject to the market, but I believe there will be taxes or something if I withdraw the money. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll be inheriting it as the investment portfolio or if it will already be cashed out. \n\nI know tossing it into a savings account is a bad idea. I withdrew my 401k after leaving my last job, and don\u2019t really know where else I should put it aside from CDs or something. I was hoping some individuals who were much more informed about this sort of thing could give me some direction.

My current hourly rate is $37 and it would stay that way if I became just a part time employee, and if I became a contractor they would offer me a rate that is 30% higher ($48/hr). I know that as a contractor I have to pay higher taxes which is why the rate is higher, but could someone help me figure out which one would give me the higher take home rate?

I am self employed and work part time; my partner works full time for an employer. Combined income about $250k. We pay for part time childcare- about $24k/year.\n\nOur house currently has 1 bathroom and laundry in the basement which is tricky to access because the stairs are very steep and narrow. We have a plan to bring the laundry up and add a half bath upstairs, which involves renovating the kitchen. The estimated cost is about $70k. We had planned to do it this year and had about $45k saved and were going to look for a HELOC or home equity loan. Unfortunately we got totally walloped with a huge tax bill ($18k) because we miscalculated our withholding. \n\nWhich brings me to the question. We have ~$35k in savings that we could liquidate remaining but this would leave us with $15k in our emergency fund. I\u2019m thinking we liquidate $25k and try to get the rest in a loan that we could then pay off in 10 years. We would start the project this winter, by which point we\u2019d have another $10k saved (we are saving pretty aggressively and my partner get a bonus in the fall; we estimated that it would be half the size it was last year to be conservative but it will likely be $10k-$20k so we would have $45-$55k). \n\nBased on that, is there a reason to go for the HELOC over the loan? Loans seem to have lower interest although you pay interest immediately but I\u2019m not sure I understand why a HELOC would be better in this type of situation (a one-off Reno). The renovation will add value to our house and also make our lives a lot easier- potty training is imminent and if we do have another kid, not having to navigate the dangerous staircase (there\u2019s unfortunately no other way to fix it without re-doing almost the whole house because of the way it\u2019s laid out) would be a huge bonus.

My fiance (26) and I make 130k together now, but we've been broke for the majority of our lives. We've been together for about 10 years and the only thing holding us back from getting married was strictly financial. \n\nWe were living in an apartment together in 2020, paying about $1500 a month. My fiance was working at her first job as a Social Worker, and I was still in school getting my Master's in Computer Science. She was already done with her Master's and starting to get some money.\n\nWhile in school, I was also working full-time at a restaurant, making roughly 30k a year. Of course, COVID hit and I had to go on unemployment while all the restaurants were shut down. I had to use a lot of my credit cards and ended up stacking up about 10-15k in credit cards. So I started panicking and applied for any and all software-related jobs out there. Luckily I chose a high demanding field to work in. \n\nUnfortunately, during my college years I worked up about 118k in student loan debt. And that's with going to community college for two years and commuting to school the rest of the other years. \n\nAfter almost an entire year of job searching and rejection after rejection, I finally landed a software engineer gig. The base pay was 63k, but that wasn't the best part. My employer contributes to paying my student loans off too. It will take roughly 10 years to pay that all off (about 8 years now). \n\nSo then I didn't have any student loan debt to worry about for the time being. After about 6 months of working there, I got YNAB just to see how chaotic my life truly was at that time. My net worth was about -160k. Absolutely terrifying. \n\nSo I started reading up on getting out of debt quickly and started watching every youtube video known to man about getting out of debt. \n\nThe biggest thing that made me realize I gotta stop using credit cards was when I went to the jewelry store for my fiance's engagement ring and had to open up another line of credit. Once I left that store, I told myself this was the last credit card I ever use. \n\nAfter that, every other check started getting thrown at my debts. I never spent any money unless I absolutely had to. I started doing doordash and uber eats after work, working maybe 60-70 hours a week. \n\nThen we really wanted to get out of our shitty apartment, so we started looking at house prices online. YIKES. We thought we were going to have to rent forever while trying to pay off this wedding. We really didn't want to return back from our honeymoon to our apartment that we hated. \n\nI finally broke down all the numbers to my fiance: we either postpone the wedding for a house, postpone the house for a wedding, OR..... move back in with our parents and get both. \n\nIt took a TON of convincing, but my fiance eventually agreed to it. When we moved out, I had about 2k to my name. \n\nAfter a little over a year of moving back home, slamming down debts and not spending any money except for the down payment and the wedding, I am now sitting in my newly-built house with 30k in the bank, zero debt (aside from the student loans being paid by my employer) and the wedding completely paid off. Got 15k in retirement, building our emergency fund and finally enjoying ourselves. Net worth went from -160k to -50k in a year. Still got work to do, but man are we such in a better situation because we swallowed our pride and did the right thing for us. \n\ntl;dr - Moving back in with our parents really saved us from working for the rest of our lives and gave us a tremendous boost. It's okay to go back home if it means that you won't have to work for the rest of your lives.", "created": 1683223652.0, "comments": ["Moving home at 28 after the pandemic began completely changed my life financially. \n\nIt also significantly hurt my social/romantic life.

Those are very expensive habits. \n\n- if one of those loans is an expensive car, see if you can sell it without losing even more money and get a very used car with hopefully better gas mileage instead.\n\n- drop all of your entertainment subscriptions (e.g. steaming services) except one to keep you sane. Drop your internet plan to the cheapest plan and your data plan to the cheapest, or switch to some garbage provider like cricket to save money. \n\n- start working out if you aren't already. This seems like a weird tip, but if you live in the US, health problems can be very expensive to fix, but very cheap to prevent. \n\nAnd last, be honest with your friends and family if you are invited to an outing that costs money. \"Sorry guys, I fucked up and I need to be a bit safer with how I spend money.

Money Market funds like SPAXX (4.53%) in Fidelity and also the VMFXX-Vanguard Federal Money Market Fund (4.79%) that can be used as the sweep for Vanguard are also very good options that both hold NAV at $1.00 so that you generally wouldn't have to worry about reporting sales on taxes due to small price fluctuations (there is a small chance those money market funds could fluctuate from $1 a little bit).", "Sofi doesn't have minimums either, not sure about Ally.

That's not that realistic, and it's going to lead you to rushing into something that's probably not ideal for you.  Not to mention that as an FHA borrower, they're more stringent on the condition of the property and they might require the seller to make certain repairs before they'll approve the loan, it also puts you at a negotiating disadvantage against other buyers that are using conventional loans.\n\nI think that you need to plan to rent for another year while you establish your income, build your savings, and start the house hunting process earlier next year.", "Something else to think about: Because of the advice on this sub, I made sure to have at least 10K in savings after closing and I am SO glad I did.

Banks for mortgage approval generally want to see that you have stable income so if your wife is just now getting a job they may not include her income in their   calculations for if you would qualify for a mortgage.

Might want to brace for that.  \n\n\nSecond if you do a 3.5% FHA loan you will be stuck with PMI for the full duration of the mortgage, are you sure you want to do that instead of just saving more until you can do a loan that will allow you to drop PMI once you hit 20% equity?  \n\n\n$200 property tax and $66/mo insurance would be extremely cheap for a $300k house, how did you arrive at those numbers?  \n\n\nBasically I would say your target of a $300k house is reasonable but you might want to wait a year after your wife gets her job and save up for a larger downpayment and apply at a time where banks would consider your income to be stable.", "How did you figure out what you could afford.

I'd honestly have $20k set aside for just a random leak emergency just in case because that's building wrecking damage right there.", "Property taxes really surprised me with my first house. I knew I\u2019d have them, but adding them to the mortgage payment was psychologically difficult because it raises the payment I\u2019d been budgeting against.  Unlike me, sounds like you\u2019re accounting for them. Don\u2019t forget to add in a lump sum escrow for taxes \u2014 the mortgage company will want to have padding in the escrow account, maybe even up to a 1/2 year payment. They can also rebalance at any time if taxes have gone up and charge more, so keep an eye out for that. \n\nAnother items to check for: some loans will let you recast 1 or more times. This means if you make a large lump sum payment, and maybe if you\u2019ve done something like have kept a high enough balance in an associated checking account for long enough, they\u2019ll recalculate the amortization schedule if you engage them. Otherwise extra payments will not typically lower your monthly payment but just reduce the number of payments (taking it off the end.. so possibly saving interest\u2026). I had planned on a lump sum pay down but learned this too late.  So you may want to budget $$ in an account you cannot touch.\n\nRelated to $$ in an account you cannot touch, sometimes you can get a lower rate if you open an associated account (that may also have a min. balance requirement). \n\nAlso, if you\u2019re thinking of ever needing a HELOC and there\u2019s equity in the house when you\u2019re buying it, it\u2019s usually much cheaper to get the HELOC at the same time.  This can be helpful because as a home owner, you can all but guarantee every appliance will break in the first year. Hot water heater. Laundry. Heating system. Dish washer. Fridge. The roof will leak.  It\u2019s ridiculous. Budget for these\u2026 rainy day fund should be 3-6 months of expenses in cash, which can cover some of these maintenance items but (in my opinion) is really intended to cover economic hardships, so having a plan for maintenance is important.\n\nFinally, many say to get the biggest fixed rate mortgage you can afford (<\u2014not saying to live beyond the calculations you\u2019re doing \u2026 this means don\u2019t get one too big) for the longest period. Don\u2019t chase 15yr or 20yr for slightly lower interest rates. The payments are higher. Instead, if early payoff is your goal, get a 30yr and make extra payments. If things go sideways for you, you can make smaller payments at the 30-yr threshold. \n\nOh, and avoid paying points to lower your interest rates or chasing variable rate ARMs. \n\nDidn\u2019t check the rest of the posts re: these comments, so apologies if they\u2019re duplicative.", "I would look at your current expenditures and % of budget going towards housing.

And that will make all the difference. As you will be paying on the interest for the first few years of the purchase and less on the principle, if you have the ability and can swing a 15 year loan instead of 30 it is something to consider. It will be a higher mortgage payment. But less interest overtime. Again, take that advice with a grain of salt, as your interest rate can change among other variables.

Your categories, however, are super-generic so there's nothing really to comment on there (especially when there's a category like \"bills.\") If I were motivated, I could probably compare your numbers to some generic \"normal\" numbers, but that wouldn't be helpful because I don't know the area you live in, your responsibilities, or your personal priorites.\n\nAbout the only three things I can say based on the information you've provided are:\n\n1. What exactly is \"lifestyle creep\" for you, and which categories did it affect?

I bought in 2018 so your results may vary, but you can do it in 2 years.\n\nHere are my tips.\n\nTry to own everything, that includes your vehicle, if you do end up having to finance a car get the bare minimum. Anything you have debt-wise will count against your ability to qualify for a mortgage. It makes no sense but you can get a newer car after your mortgage.\n\nTry to expand your amount of credit cards, but never carry a balance. Use them for things you would have bought anyways with your debit card and only if you already have the funds in the bank. Having many lets you keep the reported balances low. Banks want to see that history.\n\nDon't ever be late no matter what. It can really ruin your chances. \n\nIf you are really serious about buying a house banks want you to stay put for at least 2 years and rent for 2 years. If you get fired or evicted you will have to start over. You can job hop, but it's counter-productive for people who want to buy houses unless you can WFH.\n\nGovernment jobs don't pay much but have pretty decent stability. If you are really serious and are able to buy in 5 years, it's not a bad idea to stay the rest of the 5 to get vested.  This kills two birds because if you want to move on and sell your house you would be in the green. Depending on where you are the workload won't be as crazy as a private industry so use downtime to expand your skills. Others have said working on a degree, that is a good idea. Some states also have student loan forgiveness as well if you work in government. \n\nWhen you are ready to buy a good first-time program is the USDA loan program. You mentioned you live in a LCOL area so its possible property near you will be eligible.  They will give you a somewhat higher rate but you can always refinance down the road. They don't require a downpayment, so that leaves you with more available to cover closing and for a home emergency fund.

First of all, always keep your communication with debt collectors IN WRITING sent via USPS with certified mail and RETURN RECEIPT. They lie like we breathe air. \n\nNext, since you asked for a verification, the debt collector must stop all collections activities and contact with you unless and until they produce the validation. Again, because debt collectors are scum and lie, I would re-iterate your demand for verification in a written demand per the FDCPA (there are free templates online). Unfortunately, keep in mind that the FDCPA does not define what constitutes a proper verification, and the standard differs by state according to case law. In some states, all the debt collector technically has to do is write you a letter claiming they spoke with the creditor and confirmed the debt is real without providing any proof or documentation (sucks I know). As a practical matter, I would never accept that as proof though. Demand a FULL accounting of all charges with copies of invoices and statements; demand the original agreement bearing your signature agreeing to incur the debt; demand proof the debt collector is authorized to collect on behalf of the creditor; demand proof the debt collector is bonded and insured, etc. It's highly likely the collector has zero proof. Stand your ground and be insistent. They will probably give up and return the account to the creditor or pass it to another collector, and the process will repeat. Always assert your rights under FDCPA for every debt collections letter you receive.\n\nYou will have to work directly with each credit bureau to remove negative information on a credit report. Under the FCRA, you are entitled to dispute information in your credit report (again, there are free templates online). Again, submit these in writing with return receipt so you have legal proof of receipt. Once the credit bureau receives your dispute, they have 30 days to remove the negative information or address your complaint. They will forward your complaint to the creditor and ask for proof. If the creditor fails to respond within 30 days, which there is a good shot of that happening, the credit bureau will rule in your favor by default. Also, the credit bureaus recently made a decision to not report medical debt with initial balances of under $500. Your alleged debt of $505 likely has interest and fees baked into that, so I think your dispute should be awarded on those grounds alone, and I would mention that in the complaint.", "Proving the debt can be complicated for them due to HIPAA.

Don't volunteer information such as \"Well, I got a surgery last year, but they told me I'm 100% paid up, why are you calling me?\"\n* Never, ever agree to any payment plans or make any installment payments. They'll say stuff like \"Just make a small payment, whatever you can afford. $10 this month and we'll take it off your credit report.\" Doing this means you've claimed responsibility for the debt and have reset the collections period as well.\n* Keep a log of your communications, even if it's just a note of the date and time you spoke to someone, ***their*** ***name and role at the collections agency***, and what was said\n* Dispute this with the credit bureaus.", "Dispute it across all three credit agencies, Experian & Credit Karma apps let you do it electronically and cover them all.

Cons: This would reduce my cash reserve, increasing my risk exposure to surprise expenses. Cash would no longer accrue potential investment gains.\n2. Use cash to pay additional towards principle on each mortgage payment\n    1. Pros: Reduce effective life of loan, therefore reducing interest paid, but not as much as option 1 (?). Improves flexibility by maintaining larger cash reserves in case of emergencies/surprise expenses. Cash accrues potential investment gains. Flexibility to refinance at a lower rate in the future.\n    2. Cons: Initial mortgage payments will still all be >99% interest payments. Higher burden monthly payments\n3. Use cash to buy interest rate points - this is my least understood option\n    1. Pros: Reduce interest rate paid, but by how much? If I were to put equal amounts into downpayment or principle payments, how would it compare? Why do people choose this option vs the other two above?\n    2. Cons: Lose flexibility to refinance at a lower rate in the future, if you're buying into an artificially lower rate than market anyway.

The home is worth about $270K, so we have ~155K in equity. My wife's hours were cut at work, meaning we have a lapse in income. We have ~$9K on a LOC, and another ~1.5K in CCs. We pay $300/mo on the LOC (personal choice to try to chip away; minimum payment is around $200) and between CCs we pay a combined $150/mo. (Recap: $450/mo payments, $350/mo is minimum payment). With the recent increases in grocery and gas costs, combined with the cut in income from my wife's hours, we are essentially in about a $100/mo deficit on about $3600/mo income.\n\nExpense Breakdown (~3700/mo)\n\n* $1100 - Mortgage\n* $190 - Insurance\n* $145 - Electricity\n* $40 - Water\n* $60 - Phone Bill\n* $350 - Car payment 1\n* $230 - Car payment 2\n* $83 - Interview (FiOS)\n* $35 - Trash Service\n* $200 - Gas\n* $800 - Groceries\n* $300 - LOC Payment\n* $150 - CC Payments\n\nSome numbers are estimated/rounded but basically it comes out to just under $3700/mo.\n\nAs of right now, we have a little over $1500 combined in savings, so with no changes we will be effectively out of money in about a year.\n\nTo answer some questions you might have at this point:\n\n* At this time, my wife picking up another job is not a likely option. We cannot afford child care, and her current job was providing free childcare. She is looking for other options that either pay well enough to afford child care, or a job that provide child care, but it is difficult finding either of those at time.\n* Both cars are necessary, carpooling is not a realistic option given my schedule and our jobs are both 30+ away from our house in different directions\n* We have already cut out as much extra spending as possible; No eating out, rarely going shopping unless absolutely necessary\n* We have looked into super cheap phone services like Mint and US Mobile, but haven't found any with reliable service. We are currently both on Visible which is reliable and slightly more expensive but still not as bad as the \"big\" companies.\n\nNow, onto my real question.\n\nAs it stands, we can easily do DoorDash/courier stuff or I could pick up a second job to make up the slight deficit and attempt to build up savings, but with young kids I want to be able to spend time with them. In other words, I still want to keep quality of life in mind. (I hate to think of the possibility, but if push comes to shove and we are truly stuck between a rock and a hard place, we always have the option of selling our home and moving in with my parents temporarily. They are incredibly amazing and willing to help, but I don't think we are that point yet.)\n\nAs a last note before posting the options I am truly considering; I am expected to receive a bonus of around $5K in 5 months, as as well as a pay increase which will equate to ~$200/mo additional income.\n\nThe two main options I was considering to make up for the deficit were the following:\n\n* Pull ~$1.5K from the LOC to pay off the cards, then continue to make $300 payments in perpetuity, effectively freeing up $150/mo. This would make up the deficit long enough for the the $5K bonus to come in. Given that savings would not be built up much in the mean time, I would elect to put the $5K into savings as a rainy day/cushion fund, then increase the $300/mo payment to $400-$500 once my raise comes through.\n* Pull a $15K 15yr HEL which would have a roughly $140/mo payment (~$10K in interest over the life of the loan), to pay off the LOC and CCs in their entirety as well as put a small amount of cash in the bank again to act as a cushion for unexpected expenses. This would make up the $100/mo deficit, and allow another $300-$350 to go into savings. In this scenario I would apply the entirety of my $5K bonus to wards the HEL effectively cutting the repayment plan in half, then increasing my payment from $140/mo to $300-$400 once I receive my raise later this year, with the goal of paying off the HEL within 4-5 years, ideally sooner if I continue to apply future bonuses towards it.\n\nDo either of these sound like a reasonable option? Am I overcomplicating this? While evaluating all of this, my wife is actively pursuing employment as well, that would be the best option but it simply isn't looking promising at the moment.\n\nI appreciate any insight anyone can provide.\n\n---\n\nEdit: To clarify, I am 30. I do currently have a 401K worth about 35K. I had toyed with the idea of liquidating this to pay everything off and padding the bank account, but believe ultimately this is a bad move.

Thus far, my savings have been with a fee-only AUM financial advisor who charges me low rates but doesn't do very much (my mother has high-7 figures in assets, I used him as my advisor because he gave me the lower rates based on her assets, and kept doing so after she switched to a different advisor).\n\nI'm generally conscious of high-level \"best practices\". I get that an advisor is statistically unlikely to outperform buying index funds, I max out my employer-matched and tax-advantaged savings options, etc.\n\nI have chronic illness and various other factors that mean a primary goal is not having to actively think about finances; I want a solution I can just throw savings at every month and otherwise not really worry about it.

Switch over to my mother's new advisor. They are more expensive (0.7% if I get my mom's rate, 1% if not, and even 0.7% seems potentially high for my mother's assets), and I'm a little sketched out by some of the interactions I've had with them so far.\n2.

Find a different fee-only advisor to move both myself and my mother to.\n\nI know folks in here tend to be aggressively against financial planners, but the sense I've gotten is that advice tends to be less relevant when you're dealing with the sorts of assets my mother is. I'll likely be taking over managing my mother's money sooner rather than later (as in, managing the relationship with her advisor), and there is likely additional value in having a single relationship with a single person I trust with both my money and hers.

I already had two loans then took out three more. I'm becoming worried that I won't have enough to survive even paying just the minimums on these loans. I'm going to turn off automatic withdrawal on all of them until I have a solid plan to get the debt fully paid off or settled or discharged.

Minimum payment on it is $50, it doesn't have interest but it does have a statement balance fee of $30 which is included in the minimum payment. CL is $550\n\n5. Post Lake Lending- This one makes me the most anxious because I can't find an easily accessible customer portal, and it's a tribal installment loan. I can't find the current balance either, I imagine I will have to call, but the original loan amount was $450. The APR is 745.72% (I am sick at the thought of making such a horrible mistake here.)

I have a few medical bills floating around that I haven't crunched the numbers on yet but I did get $850 in an HSA through my work which I plan to use to pay most if not all of those off. I will receive another $850 in the account in February next year which I could use for the rest of the medical bills if they can wait that long.\n\nI feel overwhelmed, embarrassed, incredibly financially illiterate, and I don't know where to start or how to prioritize. I recognize the electric bill and tribal loan probably need to be addressed first but I'm panicked and I don't know how to come up with a plan. \n\nI pushed off the last CashNet payment due prior to my move and yesterday it took out both the last payment and the current payment that was due, now my bank account is -$240 with pending overdraft fees, which is why I plan to turn off automatic withdrawals. I luckily have enough groceries for another two weeks and close to a full tank of gas. I DoorDash when I can but right now I'm scared to run out of gas prior to my next payday (5/12) and still have a negative balance and then be unable to get to work.
