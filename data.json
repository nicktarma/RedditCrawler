If you were a full-time employee and you were having issues and they felt they needed to be addressed then they put you on what they called their employee improvement program.  They would actually work with you and try to understand the issues and fix the problem before they would let you go.  And the employee improvement program was 6 months long.  They also had a cross-training program where if rhey didn't need your position anymore they gave you the opportunity to cross train on a new one.  because this company understood the value of an employee and how much turnover cost.  They would rather invest the time and resources to training an existing employee than trying to find a new one.\n\nAnd working for non-profits is a whole another ballgame all together.\n\nAnd some companies are private and run on an ESOP where every employee is an owner of the company.

This is simply a risk the business can not afford.\n\nThis goes deeper though and goes to the reason for the termination. Is this employee not working up to standard? Did they violate a clear cut company policy or the law? Or can you simply not afford to keep them from a financial standpoint? In those situations, the writing should be on the wall. \n\nIf they are not working to standards, I wholly advocate for prior counseling. With a new employee this should be done at least at 30, 60, 90 days, 6 and 12 months. Address their sting and weak points. If they\u2019re not going to make the grade, tell them so they can either correct their work or plan to work elsewhere.\n\nIf they violate a clear cut company policy or the law, they probably didn\u2019t do that by accident.

These are all situations of pretext for shady terminations or just bad business. In those cases, yes, I agree with you whole heartedly. Frankly, if you reread my original comment in regards to big businesses, I didn\u2019t say it outright, but I would not advocate holding any kind of allegiance to the business if something better comes along. Go ahead, quit Friday and start a new job Monday. There are very few situations where that would be unwise. Shitty, but unwise.

I immediately logged in to check out my plan and make sure everything was in order. I had a notification that showed that [AT&T had \"upgraded my internet speed at no extra charge\"](https://imgur.com/LrUUetX)\n\nObviously I was annoyed by this, so I dug a little deeper to figure out why the bill had changed. I then found this alert showing that the \"promotional discount\" for this so-called [\"customer loyalty speed upgrade\"](https://imgur.com/PtYazt6) would expire in a month and my bill would go up $20 more per month. \n\nI then looked at my bill and found that they had [upgraded my plan to the highest speed and most expensive plan they have without my consent](https://imgur.com/ThJwB7J), under the guise of \"customer loyalty\", and applied a $20/month promotional rate for 1 month to make it look like my plan hadn't changed and the new bill was probably just some random $5 fee added on like most ISPs occasionally do. \n\nI immediately called and spoke to a rep named Jorge who stated that it was a mistake, that the change was applied automatically and it wasn't supposed to be applied to my account, but after telling him if it was automatic it needed to be addressed immediately because it was probably affecting other people, he confessed that AT&T was aware of it and that they had received many calls about it. I don't for one second believe this was accidental. I believe they are doing it on purpose and hoping that many people won't notice.\n\nMake sure you watch your bills, because if this happened to me it is almost certainly happening to others.

I signed up for cell service with AT&T. I also signed up to be billed on the first of the month I had them put that in my contract. The first month I received a text on the 22nd of the month saying if I didn\u2019t pay my bill my phone would be turned off. I didn\u2019t think anything of it so I paid. Next month same thing happens I get a text on the 22nd saying my bill is over due. This time I called them up to see what is going on. I talked to billing and ask why I am getting text saying my bill is late when I had it setup to be paid on the first. This is when I am informed that my cycle  starts on the 15th and end on the 15th. I told them they\u2019re wrong the contract said the first and they need to change it. The person told me that It couldn\u2019t happen until the start of a new billing cycle. Well I was pissed by this time. My contract was changed without my authorization. In the mean time I asked to be connected to customer services to see why I keep getting threatening texts and emails. I was transferred to customer service where they automatically hung up on me. So I called them back and asked to transferred to customer service and  I would get someone they would hang up on me. Right after that I get online to talk to a rep because I felt there was more they could do. The guy informs me that he could switch my billing cycle right away and does have to wait for the new billing cycle to start. He also said he would look into why customer service hung up on me. I felt I was taken care of and got off with customer service. Once off  I had the conversation emailed to me so I had a record of what I was told. I also received an email from AT&T confirming my billing cycle had changed. \n\nFast forward to the next months billing cycle, and I get the same issue texts and emails threatening me to pay my bill or my service will be turned off. So again I contact the online help. This time they try and say nothing was done and all that happened was an extension was made on my cycle for a month. They said  I never had a conversation about changing my billing cycle and what I was saying was untrue. So I start to copy and past all the information I was told from the last customer support rep and also the email AT&T sent me to confirm my billing cycle had changed. Just like magic they started to see that they did change my billing cycle. However they couldn\u2019t change it back for another three months. I informed them that due to the fact my contract with AT&T was originally signed to have my bill be paid on the first and they had changed without my consent. They had breached my original contract by changing my billing cycle without consent. Since they decided to jerk me around I informed them I was no longer going to continue my service with them. They tried to say I had to pay them for a phone and my phone bill. However, when I informed them they had breached the original contract I had setup to pay my bill on the first of the month and in doing so made the original contract null and void, and that included my payments on the phone. They agreed that I didn\u2019t have to pay my phone off or my cell phone bill. \n\nSo it goes to show you get everything in writing, keep the contract and if you contact them over a billing issue or any issue get a transcript of what you were told.

You know how if you have more than one service with AT&T, they may talk to you about combining your bills for a discount? Once they are combined, they are handled in a new department. Now, we get the short of the stick there as while each department is responsible for itself, we were responsibily knowing the full extent of all of these departments: U-verse, Mobility (cell phones), DirectV, and finally the other portion of u-verse (their television). I myself worked there for a little while and ended up heading an MST team (they are the \"managers\" you talk to. Yes, you don't actually talk to our managers, they are just a team of people with a little more power and freedom and able to descalate. Funny story about the MST, when you ask to speak to an MST's manager, we would just pass it to another person on the MST. haha). I also did training, so I know those four departments like the back of my hand. I no longer work there, but it wasn't that long ago I did.\n\nThings to consider about OP's situation: It's very likely he had a discount before they upgraded his internet, and that discount would have been running off at the same time as this one is, and thus the net price would be the same. I can't know for sure as it's not like I can access his account. If you view your bill before and after the change happened, you might see something surprising. It could also have been his contract which ensured he got a price is running up finally, and he should call back and get another one, but it all depends on his situation. \n\nHonestly, with all the issues going on, you'd be surprised how little of it is a true AT&T error and how much of it is just deceptive advertising. Your first bill from them (if combined billing) may be 2x the price you are expecting, but that is because you already technically had a bill that had a balance of 0.00, it's just not explained well. It's absolutely AT&T's fault for not training their employee's near well enough, and not explaining anything to the customers. However, I think in this case what happened is his contract is up, U-Verse typically has a price guarantee contract you sign for either two or three years, so this would make sense (it can be 2 1/2 years as well).\n\n/u/ghostofgbt I would go ahead and recommend you call the IVR (The number on your bill) and talk to a rep and ask to speak to sales to get another contract signed up for your internet to save money. That, or you can talk to loyalty and say you are displeased about them not notifying you and you're going to leave them unless they get your price down. \n\nFor anyone else with AT&T problems, I will go ahead and say that in my entire time working there, if it was ever found to be an AT&T error, it would always be corrected (albeit you'd have to call about it, the system doesn't just catch it), and you'd be given credits as well. A large part of why your bill goes up and everything has to do with all the fine terms, like I know in unified you got a certain amount off your bill for 3 services combined, versus 2, and u-verse was required for any discount. There's a lot of fine details, but if you have patience and talk to their reps, or look at the bill yourself online, you should be able to find it.\n\nHowever! There are a lot of shitty reps in AT&T, not all departments are created equally, much less the CSR's themselves. So, it may require jumping around.\n\nFinal notice here is this is for base AT&T stuff and not the acquired DirecTV. I will go ahead and say right now that DirecTV scams its users, to the point that it should be illegal. They will give you an early termination fee you don't know about, when the sales rep may assure you there is none. They WILL say they they have fixed it and removed it, while not actually removing it at all. I would say avoid getting DirecTV at all costs, and if you must, then record what the sales rep tells you and make him write down his DirecTV number on a paper that also says you will not have to pay an ETF. Seriously, in the time I was working there I saw in the notes alone plenty of examples of where stuff was supposed to be removed (like, the notes said they were going to remove it), and then it was never done. Do not trust DirecTV and monitor your bill closely. \n\nAlright that's all I have to say, figured my insight could help a few know what to do. Feel free to ask if anyone has any quick questions about AT&T billing or resources to fix them and monitor. I obviously can't go into AT&T policy without getting arrested, but I can definitely guide the way to making sure you get the best you can out of your AT&T service. Finally, only billing, loyalty, or managers can issue credits that are not caused by an actual error (but something that was confusing or bad service), so don't demand credits from your customer service reps. You are going to get them if there was an actual AT&T \"error\" (sorry, I can't define them, but pretty much system messed up or something), however you are still entitled to credits if you were told one thing and another happens, so feel free to get to a manager for that.\n\nAlso I will never have AT&T, after working there. I work for t-mobile now, dealing with small/medium businesses, but I know those who are just basic CSRs and I can say if you want a company that actually has decent customer service and more lenient policies, go to them. \n\n", "Crap, I just noticed in my last bill they bumped me up to 75 from 50 \"complementary.\"  I was going to call in about this and forgot with the holidays...thanks for the reminder.

The reason this happened is the cycle that the bill was sent to unified (combined billing), and the cycle of each independent bill were separate, thus it would take a month or two for it to get fixed. What this means is you would pay nothing for a month, maybe even two months while the system aligned the billing cycles, and then the next bill after that would be 2-3x what you are expecting.
