My fiance (26) and I make 130k together now, but we've been broke for the majority of our lives. We've been together for about 10 years and the only thing holding us back from getting married was strictly financial. \n\nWe were living in an apartment together in 2020, paying about $1500 a month. My fiance was working at her first job as a Social Worker, and I was still in school getting my Master's in Computer Science. She was already done with her Master's and starting to get some money.\n\nWhile in school, I was also working full-time at a restaurant, making roughly 30k a year. Of course, COVID hit and I had to go on unemployment while all the restaurants were shut down. I had to use a lot of my credit cards and ended up stacking up about 10-15k in credit cards. So I started panicking and applied for any and all software-related jobs out there. Luckily I chose a high demanding field to work in. \n\nUnfortunately, during my college years I worked up about 118k in student loan debt. And that's with going to community college for two years and commuting to school the rest of the other years. \n\nAfter almost an entire year of job searching and rejection after rejection, I finally landed a software engineer gig. The base pay was 63k, but that wasn't the best part. My employer contributes to paying my student loans off too. It will take roughly 10 years to pay that all off (about 8 years now). \n\nSo then I didn't have any student loan debt to worry about for the time being. After about 6 months of working there, I got YNAB just to see how chaotic my life truly was at that time. My net worth was about -160k. Absolutely terrifying. \n\nSo I started reading up on getting out of debt quickly and started watching every youtube video known to man about getting out of debt. \n\nThe biggest thing that made me realize I gotta stop using credit cards was when I went to the jewelry store for my fiance's engagement ring and had to open up another line of credit. Once I left that store, I told myself this was the last credit card I ever use. \n\nAfter that, every other check started getting thrown at my debts. I never spent any money unless I absolutely had to. I started doing doordash and uber eats after work, working maybe 60-70 hours a week. \n\nThen we really wanted to get out of our shitty apartment, so we started looking at house prices online. YIKES. We thought we were going to have to rent forever while trying to pay off this wedding. We really didn't want to return back from our honeymoon to our apartment that we hated. \n\nI finally broke down all the numbers to my fiance: we either postpone the wedding for a house, postpone the house for a wedding, OR..... move back in with our parents and get both. \n\nIt took a TON of convincing, but my fiance eventually agreed to it. When we moved out, I had about 2k to my name. \n\nAfter a little over a year of moving back home, slamming down debts and not spending any money except for the down payment and the wedding, I am now sitting in my newly-built house with 30k in the bank, zero debt (aside from the student loans being paid by my employer) and the wedding completely paid off. Got 15k in retirement, building our emergency fund and finally enjoying ourselves. Net worth went from -160k to -50k in a year. Still got work to do, but man are we such in a better situation because we swallowed our pride and did the right thing for us. \n\ntl;dr - Moving back in with our parents really saved us from working for the rest of our lives and gave us a tremendous boost. It's okay to go back home if it means that you won't have to work for the rest of your lives.", "created": "1683223652.0"}{"title": "Possibly buying a house this summer.

We are looking at getting an FHA loan, which requires at least **3.5%** down.\n\nI averaged her salary numbers and made it **$55,500** for her gross income which makes our household gross income **$104,497** for FY24. I currently have around **$6k** saved up for a down payment and plan to have up to **$10,643** in July, and we have to move out of our rental on August 1.\n\nI am going by the rule that I've heard, which is that your monthly mortgage budget should be less than **28%** of your gross monthly income, which for us would be **$2,438/mo**. \n\nUsing a mortgage calculator, I calculated that my monthly mortgage for a **$300,000** house at **6.5% APR** and a **$10,643** down payment would be **$2,242**, which accounts for **$150 for PMI**, **$66 for homeowners insurance**, and **$200 for property taxes.** \n\nI want to make sure before we start looking seriously for houses that there's nothing (other than closing costs/utilities) that I'm failing to account for. Any input would be greatly appreciated. \n\n\\- Also worth noting, my salary will go up yearly for adding years of creditable service to my contract, so our gross yearly income SHOULD continue to increase, and even more so when I get my Master's degree and professional teaching certificate. \n\nPlease let me know if you think my budget is too aggressive, if there's anything I'm not considering, or any other input you might have!\n\nThank you all for your help.", "created": "1683207253.0"}{"title": "I'm 50 and I want to retire today.
